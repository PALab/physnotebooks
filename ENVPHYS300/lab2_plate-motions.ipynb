        "Plate tectonics is the study of the movement and evolution of rigid plates. A tectonic plate involves the lithosphere and part of the mantle and moves over the Asthenosphere, which is the viscous part of the Earth’s mantle. The location of seismic, volcanic and orogenetic activity tells us where these plate boundaries are. There are three types of plate boundaries: convergent (subduction), divergent (mid-ocean ridges) and transform. At convergent and divergent boundaries, Earth material is *recycled*. Transform boundaries are defined by strike slip (transform) faults, which provide stress relief in structures associated with divergent and convergent margins.\n",
        "\n",
        "Plate velocities are important to understand the formation of the Earth, the geological evolution of a region, as well as earthquake mechanics. Knowing how rocks geologically correlate between continents requires knowledge of plate velocities and geology, with implications to other fields: paleo-oceanography, paleo-climate and palaeontology, among others."

        "So far, you have calculated plate motion on a flat Earth. To apply such knowledge to our Earth, we need to define the movement of  plates on a sphere. Plate motion on a sphere can be harder to visualise compared to motion on a flat plane. In order to help you to understand the concepts in these sections, watch these two videos which demonstrate how we analyse the motion of tectonic plates on Earth:\n",

        "In the videos, we saw that the motion of a plate can be described by rotation around a fixed axis. The point where the axis intersects the surface of the Earth is called Euler’s point or pole. (Note: this comes from a corollary to Euler’s theorem: \"*the displacement of a rigid body on the surface of a sphere is equivalent to the rotation about an axis that passes through its center*\".)  We can therefore estimate the movement of a plate on Earth by defining the location of the Euler’s pole and the angular velocity $\\omega$ of the plate. By using the *right hand rule* we are able to define the direction of the positive pole, and thus the direction of the positive angular velocity.\n",

        "For a spherical Earth we divide the sphere into *small* circles (think of a latitude **from** your Euler’s pole) and *great circles* (think of a longitude **from** your Euler’s pole). All the great circles have to cross the Euler’s pole. The velocity of the plate on the surface of the sphere depends on the angular distance from the pole. As for a flat Earth, relative angular velocity follows the same notation (${}_{B}\\omega_{A}$) and ${}_{B}\\omega_{A}=-{}_{A}\\omega_{B}$. Figure 3 shows the definitions of the movement of a plate on a sphere. We are interested in estimating the velocity at a specific point on the surface ($v_x$). The plate velocity at point $x$ depends on the angular velocity $\\omega$ and the angle (*latitude*) from Euler’s pole. It can be seen that velocity is maximum at the *equator* (referenced to this Euler pole) and decreases towards Euler’s pole. If we know the radius of the Earth ($R$), angular velocity of our plate, Euler’s pole location of that plate and the 'latitude' of the point of interest ($x$), we can estimate the velocity of the plate at $x$:\n",
