    "Real experiments involve <span class='myclass'>real</span> measurements, which are not perfect. Because of parasitic phenomena, sensitivity of the experiment to noise, or mis-reading of scales, the results we get are generally not the exact values we would like them to be. Moreover, when repeating the same measurement, we often obtain a different result! These \"errors\" in measurements, more properly called **uncertainties**, need to be properly estimated and quoted when you write up your results. Failure to do so may mean that your results are useless. Consider an error of 1 mm on a distance measurement. If you are measuring the distance to a planet, a 1-mm error is actually very small and that measurement very accurate. But if you happen to try to determine the length of a molecule (which are typically much smaller than 1 mm), then a 1-mm error is pretty bad, and it really means that you have no idea about the length of that molecule. It all depends on context! \n",

    "\n",
    "Here you are, facing the measuring apparatus of your experiment. This could be a simple ruling stick, a dial with a moving pointer, or the digital display of some sensor. You are reading a value off that measuring tool. What is the uncertainty in that value?\n",
    "\n",
    "### A.1 Uncertainty in an individual measurement\n",
    "\n",
    "The uncertainty in a <i>non-repeated</i> measurement can be estimated as **the minimum resolution of the measuring device**. This is often quoted as being half of the smallest division of the measuring apparatus. For example, a reasonable estimate of uncertainty in a single measurement with a typical meter stick, which has ticks every one millimeter, is &plusmn;&nbsp;0.5&nbsp;mm. Similary, with a digital voltmeter that diplays three significant digits, like 3.73&nbsp;V, the uncertainty would correspond to half the value associated with the least significant digit, in this case &plusmn;&nbsp;0.005&nbsp;V.\n",
    "\n",
    "**It may happen that the value you are trying to read is slowly, randomly varying over time,** because of parastic phenomena (e.g. vibrations). Say for example that your voltage reading varies betwen 3.68 and&nbsp;3.76&nbsp;V. In that case, you would quote the measurement as the mean value between the minimum and maximum value you can read, (3.68 V + 3.76 V) / 2 = 3.72 V, and the uncertainty as half the spread of values, (3.76&nbsp;V&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;3.68 V) / 2 = 0.04 V, giving you for this example a reading of 3.72&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;0.04&nbsp;V. More on this below.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a general rule, if you estimate the uncertainty of a quantity in two different ways, and you get two different results (e.g. &plusmn;&nbsp;0.005&nbsp;V from the resolution, and &plusmn;&nbsp;0.04&nbsp;V from the fluctuations), you use the **largest** value for the uncertainty. Essentially, you neglect the one that has the least influence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now consider again the above example, but this time imagine the oscillations are slow enough that you can read ten different values of that measurement. You put these in a Python/NumPy array (you will learn more about that if you do the \\#202 or \\#213 experiment on Python):"

Here estimating the uncertaintly (which really is the standard deviation that you would observe over many such measurements) should be guided by your knowledge of the random process. For radioactive decay counts, which follow a Poisson distribution, a count of *N* is affected by an uncertaintly of $\\sqrt{N}$.\n",

    "Rather than blindly accepting what Python puts out, let us try to understand how uncertainties are propagated in a calculation. Assuming that all our uncertainties have a *Gaussian statistical distribution*. For x = 4 &plusmn; 0.1, that means that the probability distribution that leads to these (seemingly) random values for *x* as we keep measuring it have a Gaussian distribution, centered on 4 (the mean) and with a standard deviation of 0.1. In a Gaussian distribution there is a 68% chance that the actual (exact) value is within &plusmn;&nbsp;1 standard deviation of the nominal value (here, 4). Distributions are not always Gaussians but there are many reasons why they often turn out to be Gaussian. In particular, this is often the case for *repeated measurements* where you have estimated the uncertainties with the standard deviation and standard error (see part A).\n",
    "\n",
    "When **adding or subtracting** two values with Gaussian uncertainties, $z = x + y$ or $z = x - y$, the laws of probabilites predict that the uncertainty $\\sigma_z$ on the result $z$ is given by\n",

    "where $\\sigma_x$ ($\\sigma_y$) is the uncertainty of $x$ ($y$). If you have more than two variables to add, just keep adding the uncertainties-squared inside the square-root in the above formula. This way of \"adding\" the (absolute) uncertainties by \"taking the square-root of the sum of the squares\" is said to be a **quadrature sum of uncertainties**. The fact that the uncertainty $\\sigma_z$ is not just the direct sum of the uncertainties (which would be larger) reflects the fact that, given that the uncertainties are random (and have random signs), they will not always act in the same direction. And when you take into account all the possibilities, with their probabilities, you get the quadrature-sum result. Notice also how uncertainties always **add**, even when **substracting** the values.\n",
    "\n",
    "When **multiplying or dividing**  two values with Gaussian uncertainties, $z = x * y$ or $z = x / y$, the **relative**  uncertainty $\\sigma_z/z$ on the result is the quadrature sum of the **relative** uncertainties,\n",

    "The trick here is that **the quadrature-sum rules for the propagation of uncertainties** laid out above (for the sum/difference/product/division) **are only correct if the uncertainties in the different variables are independent**. What does that mean? When we say *x* = 5 &plusmn; 0.4, all we know is that there is a 68% chance that the TRUE value of  and *x* lies in the interval [5 &minus; 0.4 ; 5 + 0.4]. In particular, we do not know if it is larger or smaller than&nbsp;5. If I consider a second variable, *y* = 3 &plusmn; 0.2, again I do not know whether the true value of *y* is larger or smaller than&nbsp;3. Now if *x* and *y* are *independent*, the fact that the true value of *x* is &mdash; say &mdash; larger than&nbsp;5 does not imply anything as to the true value of *y*. It could still be larger or smaller than&nbsp;3 with equal probabilities. There are no **correlations** between the errors on the two variables &mdash; in particular their relative sign is random. In contrast, **dependent** variables would exhibit such correlations. For example, we may know, because of specificities of the experiment, that if I measure a value for *x* that is too large, then my measurement for the value of *y* will also be too large. Such uncertainties are said to **correlated**, hence **not independent**. If the uncertainties of two variables systematically have the opposite sign, they are said to be **anti-correlated**.\n",

The quadrature sum rule therefore does not apply, and the 2nd result calculated above is NOT correct. Python gives the right result. In fact, the Python's **uncertainties** module is quite clever. Even if you have many intermediate results, that depend somehow on the same variable(s), it will correctly track the dependant and independant variables for you. This makes your life much (much) easier!\n",

Note that the variable *y*, which is the (exact) number&nbsp;2, has no correlation with *x* whatsoever. These are independent variables and we can apply the product rule for uncertainties as defined above. But what is the uncertainty on *y*? Well clearly, it is zero, $\\sigma_y = 0$: becasue of factor of 2 is an **exact** number, it has no uncertainties.\n",

However, you can also see how the green bar on the left, centered on $x_1=2$, **intercepts a wider vertical swath of the (blue) log curve** than around $x_2=15$ on the right, as visualized by the different thicknesses of the **red** bars. This naturally explains why the **absolute** uncertainty on $y_1$ is larger than that for $y_2$.\n",
