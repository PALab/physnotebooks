    "## The centre of Mass\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab will introduce you to concept of the centre of mass with examples, experiments, and numerical calculations. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are 9 tasks for 45 points in total.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Aims\n",
    "The learning outcomes include:\n",
    "- learning about the centre of mass\n",
    "- doing integration and summation\n",
    "- gaining experience in python programming\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "Everybody has balanced their pencil on their finger in class. You know from experience that the balance point is at --or very near -- the middle of the pencil. If the pencil has a heavy rubber on the end, you need to account for that, and move your finger closer to the heavy rubber to keep the balance. This balance point is called the centre of mass. Today we will expand on this idea. \n",
    "\n",
    "The centre of mass is the point where \"the weighted relative position of the mass in a volume sums to zero.\" For today, we will stick to objects with a uniform density distribution. In this cas,e the centre of mass of an object $V$ is defined to be at the point $(\\bar{x},\\bar{y},\\bar{z})$ where\n",

    "\\begin{eqnarray*}\n",
    "\\bar{x} = \\frac{\\int_V x\\, dV}{\\int_VdV} \\, , ~~~~\n",
    "\\bar{y} = \\frac{\\int_V y\\, dV}{\\int_VdV} \\, , ~~~~\n",
    "\\bar{z} = \\frac{\\int_V z\\, dV}{\\int_VdV} \\, .\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray*}\n",
    "\n",
    "The multiplication under the integral sign of the numerator and dividing by the total volume (the denominator) do the weighting.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can analytically determine the centre of mass for regularly-shaped objects, such as circles and squares. HOwever, you may have been given an object with an irregular shape. For those objects especially, we will turn analytic integration into summation of small parts of the object. Your numerical result will be compared to experimental estimation of the centre of mass, but let us first do the physical experiment to help us understand the concept of a centre of mass."

    "In this lab, you were presented with one or more pieces of PVC plastic with small holes. Each piece has a unique shape. You also need string and a pin. When you hang your object from one of these holes, it hangs in balance. **This means that there is as much mass to the left as to the right of the extension of the line through the object.** \n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of a long, thin pencil, there is only one axis to hang a pencil from: the middle between the tip and the end. (We ignore the wizards among you, who can balance a pencil *on* its tip or end.) In other words, a long  and thin pencil can be considered 1-dimensional, but our plastic pieces have 2 dimensions. This means the centre of mass of our plastic pieces is a point with an x and a y-coordinate (but not a third z-coordinate):\n",

    "\n",
    "Hang the plastic piece from a string connected to one of the holes in the plastic piece. Use a fine-tipped water-soluble marker pen or a pencil to draw the extension of the string from the pin to the hole on the pieces of plastic. This line divides the weighted average to the left and right of this line. Now hang the piece from the other holes and repeat drawing the extension of the wire onto the piece in pencil or water-soluble marker. The intersection of the lines should define a single point: the centre of mass.\n",
