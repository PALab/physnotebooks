This lab has a few areas to watch:

- software

opencv needs to be installed in the lab computers for this lab to
work. Instructions are in the handout, in case students want to use
their device.

- scanning figures:

students should figure out that the smallest size scan with the
largest resolution gives the best result. Try not to just tell them,
but rather ask the right questions.


- Accuracy of the estimates of the centre of mass

As with any computations, there is a tendency for students to provide
many, many insignifant digits in their estimates. Ask questions about
how precise they expect their estimates to be.

- the oneclick function

the oneclick function responds to the left or single click of the
mouse. This means that it gives a false pick when zooming in, before
clicking on the holes. Student *should* zoom in to get the best
result, but ignore the zoom click. Can be fixed with a response to a
double click in the oneclick function, in the future. Still, if
students pay attention, they will notice the phantom holes.
