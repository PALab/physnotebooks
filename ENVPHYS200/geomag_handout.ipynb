    "### Lab 3: Geomagnetism [maximum 70 pts]\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a lab about the magnetic field on Earth. In this notebook you will use python to look at approximations of the geomagnetic field, download magnetic field data, and interpret the results. In class we learned about that the Earth's magnetic field is predominantly that of a dipole. We didn't go into the details but the magnetic field strength as a function of the magnetic latitude $\\lambda_m$ is $$|\\vec{\\bf B}| = \\frac{\\mu_0 m}{4\\pi r^3}\\sqrt{1+3\\sin^2(\\lambda_m)},$$ where $m=8\\times10^{22}$ Am$^2$ is the magnetic moment, a measure of the strength of the dipole, $\\mu_0=4\\pi*10^{âˆ’7}$ H/m is the magnetic permeability in vacuum, and $r=6371000$ m is the approximate radius of the Earth.
