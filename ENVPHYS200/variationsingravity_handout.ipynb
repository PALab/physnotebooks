    "#### The gravitational acceleration on the Earth's surface\n",
    "Last week, we discussed that $g\\approx$9.8m/s$^2$ everywhere on Earth. We discussed in class the implications of a spherically symmetric Earth with great(er) density toward the centre. This week, we learned in class that things are a bit more nuanced than that. $g$ at the Earth's surface is almost constant. The biggest deviating factor is that we are more spheroidal than spherical, first postulated by Isaac Newton (see you classnotes). The result is that a much better representation of $g$ at the Earth's surface is a function of latitude $\\phi$:  \n",
