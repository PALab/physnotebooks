    "In this lab, we will explore how seismic ray tracing can be used to model the propagation of seismic energy through the earth. Using ray tracing, we will estimate the epicentral distance and origin time for an earthquake.\n",

    "Chapter 11 of [A Guided Tour of Mathematical Methods for the Physical Sciences](http://www.cambridge.org/nz/academic/subjects/physics/mathematical-methods/guided-tour-mathematical-methods-physical-sciences-3rd-edition#W7jZxE54KWWuUWEC.97), *Scale Analysis*, discusses the conditions where waves can be considered in terms of ray theory. This is not a bad approximation when the spatial variability in the physical parameters that define the wave propagation is large compared to the propagating wavelengths. In that case, the wave equation, can be reduced to the Eikonal equation, which describes the travel time $T$ of a seismic ray in a medium with wave speed $v({\\bf r})$ as $$ |\\nabla T({\\bf r})|^2 = 1/v({\\bf r})^2.$$ In our book you can read how to derive [Snell's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snell%27s_law) from the Eikonal equation, for example. \n",

A triangle shows that $\\sin(i) = rd\\Delta/ds$  Thirdly, Snell's Law in a spherically symmetric Earth is $r\\sin (i) /v(r)=p$. This constant $p$ is called the ray parameter. \n",
