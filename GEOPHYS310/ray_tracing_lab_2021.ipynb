It turns out, this is not a bad approximation when the spatial variability in the physical parameters that define the wave propagation is large compared to the propagating wavelengths. Then, the Eikonal equation describes the travel time $T$ for a ray in a medium with wave speed $v({\\bf r})$ as $$ |\\nabla T({\\bf r})|^2 = 1/v({\\bf r})^2.$$ \n",
