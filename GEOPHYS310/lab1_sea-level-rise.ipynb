    "Australian scientists show historic data also support our linear regression results of a [1 to 2 mm/y rise in sea level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_level_rise) averaged over the last 100+ years. However, tidal gauge and satellite data from the last decade(s) indicate sea level may now be rising at double this rate, according to the latest IPCC! With this info, have another look at the Auckland data. Most sea level values in the 2000s falls *above* the regression line. It would require more than data from just one tidal gauge to attribute this significant, of course. Especially when you learn that the Auckland tidal gauge has been moved site three times since 2000. However, for the sake of a fitting exercise, write code to fit these data with a polynomial (see example above) and [an exponentional function](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.curve_fit.html). Plot the data with the linear, polynomial, and exponential fits on the same plot, and caluclate the residuals for each of the fits. "
