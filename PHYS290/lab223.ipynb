    "The central theme is around calculations on the **centre of mass**, an important topic of introductary physics, particularly in classical mechanics. The calculation of the centre of mass involves **multi-dimensional integration**, and this lab teaches both **analytic** and **numerical** integration (summation). The numerical integration involves learning **python** and its modules on numerics with **numpy** and data visualization with **matplotlib**."
